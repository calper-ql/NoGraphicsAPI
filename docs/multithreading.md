# Multithreading audit

State of CPU-side thread safety in the NGAPI Vulkan implementation, as of the
fork of `multithreading_support` (post static-samplers). Every public entry
point in `NoGraphicsAPI_Impl.h` was walked against the shared state it touches
in `NoGraphicsAPI_Impl.cpp`.

**Verdict: the implementation is single-threaded today.** Nothing is locked,
several pieces of shared mutable state sit on the hottest paths, and the one
Vulkan object that structurally forbids parallel recording (a single
`VkCommandPool`) is shared by every command buffer. None of this is
criticism — the blog post's API is silent on threading, and the samples are
single-threaded — but it means "multithreading support" is real work, not a
sprinkle of mutexes.

## Target contract (proposed)

The blog says nothing about threading; its one relevant choice — transient
command buffers (`gpuStartCommandRecording` → `gpuSubmit`, no reuse) — happens
to map cleanly onto parallel recording. The contract worth implementing, in
line with what Vulkan/Metal users expect:

1. **Resource creation/destruction is thread-safe**: `gpuMalloc`/`gpuFree`,
   `gpuCreateTexture`, `gpu*ViewDescriptor`, `gpuCreate*Pipeline`,
   `gpuCreateSemaphore`, acceleration structures — callable from any thread
   concurrently.
2. **Command recording is parallel across command buffers**: one thread per
   `GpuCommandBuffer`; a single command buffer is externally synchronized
   (never two threads in one `cb`, which nobody expects anyway).
3. **Queues are internally synchronized**: `gpuSubmit`, `gpuWaitSemaphore`
   and `gpuPresent` may be called from any thread.
4. **Externally synchronized (documented, not locked)**: instance/device
   create/destroy, and each swapchain (`gpuSwapchainImage`/`gpuPresent` pairs
   belong to one thread at a time).

## Shared-state inventory and findings

Ordered by severity.

### 1. Single `VkCommandPool` per device — the structural blocker

`VulkanDevice::commandPool` backs every command buffer.
`gpuStartCommandRecording` allocates from it, `gpuWaitSemaphore` frees into
it, and — the part that blocks the headline feature — *recording* into two
command buffers from the same pool concurrently is itself invalid: every
`vkCmd*` allocates from the pool's allocator, and pools are externally
synchronized. Even with all the maps fixed, two threads recording two
separate command buffers would still be a spec violation.

Affected: `gpuStartCommandRecording`, every `gpuCmd`-style call (`gpuDispatch`,
`gpuDraw*`, `gpuBarrier`, `gpuMemCpy`, copies/blits, render passes,
`gpuBuildAccelerationStructures`), `gpuWaitSemaphore` (frees).

Fix direction: a pool per `GpuCommandBuffer` (transient model: create pool +
buffer in `gpuStartCommandRecording`, destroy the pool at retirement —
simplest, correct, slightly wasteful) or a per-thread pool cache (faster,
more machinery). The retirement bookkeeping (`submittedCommandBuffers`)
then tracks pools instead of buffers.

### 2. `allocations` vector — unsynchronized reads and writes on hot paths

`std::vector<Allocation>` mutated by `createAllocation` (`push_back`,
invalidates everything) and `freeAllocation` (`erase`), linearly scanned by
`findAllocation`. The scan is not just in allocation calls: it runs inside
**`gpuSetActiveTextureHeapPtr`** (every dispatch/draw setup),
`gpuHostToDevicePointer`, `gpuCreateTexture`, and the lazy heap inits. A
`gpuMalloc` on one thread while another thread records is undefined behavior
today.

Fix direction: `std::shared_mutex` (reads dominate; writers are
malloc/free), or a stable container + read-copy-update if the scan ever
shows up in profiles. Independently worthwhile: the linear scan is O(n) per
lookup and `gpuFree` is O(n) — an interval map would fix both.

### 3. `currentPipeline` — a device-global map for per-command-buffer state

`std::map<GpuCommandBuffer, GpuPipeline>` written by `gpuSetPipeline` (every
recording thread), erased in `gpuSubmit`, read by the descriptor-patching
path. This is per-`cb` state living on the device for no structural reason.

Fix direction: move the field into `GpuCommandBuffer_T`. Removes the race
*and* a map lookup per bind. No locking needed afterward.

### 4. Queue submission and retirement

- `gpuSubmit` calls `vkQueueSubmit` — `VkQueue` is externally synchronized,
  and `gpuCreateQueue` always returns the *same* underlying graphics queue,
  so two "different" `GpuQueue`s submitting concurrently still race.
- `gpuPresent` fetches that same graphics queue and submits the layout
  transition on it — racing any concurrent `gpuSubmit` — then presents on
  `presentQueue`.
- `gpuSubmit` writes and `gpuWaitSemaphore` reads/erases
  `submittedCommandBuffers` (and the wait-side retire loop also frees into
  the shared command pool, see §1).

Fix direction: one mutex per underlying `VkQueue` (submit + present
transition take the graphics-queue mutex; present takes the present-queue
mutex), and the retirement map either under the same lock or replaced by the
per-`cb`-pool scheme from §1.

### 5. Lazy initialization on first use

First-use creation happens in awkward places with no synchronization:

- `gpuSetActiveTextureHeapPtr` (i.e., *inside command recording*) lazily
  creates the sampler descriptor heap, the patched-descriptor heaps, the
  `PatchDescriptorsData` block, and — via `gpuCreateComputePipeline` — the
  embedded patch pipeline, which itself walks the static-sampler machinery.
- `gpuTextureViewDescriptor` / `gpuRWTextureViewDescriptor` lazily allocate
  `descriptorDataCpu`/`rwDescriptorDataCpu` and bump the unsynchronized
  `descriptorsUsed`/`rwDescriptorsUsed` counters (descriptor-patching
  devices only, e.g. lavapipe — RADV takes the raw-blob path, which is
  thread-clean).

Fix direction: eager-create everything fixed-size at device creation
(sampler heap, patch pipeline, patch heaps — they are all bounded by
`descriptorCount`), make the counters atomic. Eliminates the whole class.

### 6. Static-sampler machinery at pipeline creation

`staticSamplerSlot` reads/writes `staticSamplerSlots`, `staticSamplers`,
`nextSamplerSlot`, and writes a descriptor into the sampler heap. Two
threads creating pipelines concurrently race the dedup map and can double-
allocate slots.

Fix direction: a small mutex around slot lookup/creation. Pipeline creation
is otherwise thread-safe (`vkCreateShaderModule`/`vkCreate*Pipelines` are
internally synchronized at the device level).

### 7. Instance-level odds and ends (minor, init-time)

- `gpuCreateInstance` / `gpuDestroyInstance` mutate the global
  `vulkanInstance` unsynchronized (double-create TOCTOU).
- `gpuDeviceCount`/`gpuDeviceDesc` lazily populate `deviceDescs`
  (concurrent first calls duplicate entries).
- `gpuSwapchainImage` uses the device-wide `acquireFence` — two swapchains
  (or threads) acquiring concurrently race it; it belongs on the swapchain.

Fix direction: document instance/device lifecycle as externally
synchronized (standard), move `acquireFence` into the swapchain, and treat
each swapchain as externally synchronized.

## What is already fine

- All pure `vkCmd*` recording calls touch only their command buffer — once
  §1 and §3 are fixed, recording parallelizes with no locks.
- Creation functions (`vkCreate*`) are internally synchronized by Vulkan at
  the device level; only our bookkeeping around them races.
- `gpuWaitSemaphore`'s actual wait (`vkWaitSemaphores`) is thread-safe; only
  the retirement bookkeeping isn't.
- Handle wrappers (`GpuTexture_T`, `GpuPipeline_T`, ...) are immutable after
  creation.
- On non-patching devices the descriptor-blob path (`gpu*ViewDescriptor`)
  is already thread-clean.

## Suggested implementation order

1. **Per-`cb` command pools + `currentPipeline` into `GpuCommandBuffer_T`**
   (§1, §3) — unlocks parallel recording, no locks on the record path.
2. **`allocations` under a `shared_mutex`** (§2) — makes malloc/free and
   pointer translation safe.
3. **Queue mutexes + retirement rework** (§4).
4. **Eager init + atomic descriptor counters** (§5), **sampler mutex** (§6).
5. **Documentation of the contract** (§7 + the API header).

Verification: a headless stress test (N threads × record/submit/wait loops +
concurrent malloc/free and pipeline creation) run under the validation
layers' thread-safety checks (`VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` reports
externally-synchronized-object races precisely), plus the existing goldens
to prove the single-threaded paths didn't move.
